/* Adds gradient transparency to st, depends on the alpha patch.

/* This patch allows st to reize to any pixel size rather than snapping to character width/height.
 * https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/
 */
#define ANYSIZE_PATCH 0

/* This patch aims to prevent black bars being drawn on the edges of st terminals using the anysize
 * patch. This generally only occurs when the terminal background color doesn't match the colors
 * set in st's config.h file, for example when using terminal theming scripts such as base16.
 * (I have not found this to be working, but adding for reference. May reduce flickering on
 * terminal resizes.)

/* By default bold text is rendered with a bold font in the bright variant of the current color.

#define EXTERNALPIPE_PATCH 0

/* This patch improves and extends the externalpipe patch in two ways:
 *    - it prevents the reset of the signal handler set on SIGCHILD, when
 *      the forked process that executes the external process exits and
 *    - it adds the externalpipein function to redirect the standard output
 *      of the external command to the slave size of the pty, that is, as if
 *      the external program had been manually executed on the terminal
 *
 * It can be used to send desired escape sequences to the terminal with a
 * keyboard shortcut. The patch was created to make use of the dynamic-colors
 * tool that uses the OSC escape sequences to change the colors of the terminal.
 *
 * This patch depends on EXTERNALPIPE_PATCH being enabled.

/* This patch adds SIXEL graphics support for st.
 * Note that patch/sixel.c/sixel_hls.c come from mintty, licensed under GPL.
 * Known issues:
 *    - Entering clear causes all sixels to be deleted from scrollback.
 *    - Rendering sixel graphics may cause unusual cursor placement, this is
 *      not specific to this variant of st - the same issue is present in
 *      the xterm implementation. This is likely an issue of sixel height
 *      not being detected correctly.
 *    - If combined with the alpha patch sixel graphics disappear (become white)
 *      when transparent and rendered against a white background. This is believed
 *      to be related to how the sixel graphics use RGB colors instead of RGBA.
 *      A pull request or instructions for how to properly add alpha support for
 *      sixel graphics would be very welcome.
