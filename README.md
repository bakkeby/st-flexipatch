Similar to [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) this st 0.8.4 (367803, 2020-06-19) project has a different take on st patching. It uses preprocessor directives to decide whether or not to include a patch during build time. Essentially this means that this build, for better or worse, contains both the patched _and_ the original code. The aim being that you can select which patches to include and the build will contain that code and nothing more.

For example to include the `alpha` patch then you would only need to flip this setting from 0 to 1 in [patches.h](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch/blob/master/patches.def.h):
```c
#define ALPHA_PATCH 1
```

Once you have found out what works for you and what doesn't then you should be in a better position to choose patches should you want to start patching from scratch.

Alternatively if you have found the patches you want, but don't want the rest of the flexipatch entanglement on your plate then you may want to have a look at [flexipatch-finalizer](https://github.com/bakkeby/flexipatch-finalizer); a custom pre-processor tool that removes all the unused flexipatch code leaving you with a build that contains the patches you selected.

Refer to [https://st.suckless.org/](https://st.suckless.org/) for details on the st terminal, how to install it and how it works.
